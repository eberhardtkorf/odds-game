Theoretical and Simulated Calculator for the 'Odds Game' commonly played among students.

Give the maximum number both players of the game can say and the script will calculate the probability that the player will have to complete a dare according to the rules of the game.

The probability is calculated both theoretically and through a simulation with 100000 permutations.

The simulation's result converges to the theoretical probability proving that the formula to calculate the probability holds.
